# Song Genre Prediction

Song Genre Prediction Project

Over the past few years, streaming services with huge catalogues have become the primary means through which most people listen to their favourite music. But at the same time, the sheer amount of music on offer can mean users might be a bit overwhelmed when trying to look for newer music that suits their tastes.

For this reason, streaming services have looked into means of categorizing music to allow for personalized recommendations. One method involves direct analysis of the raw audio information in a given song, scoring the raw data on a variety of metrics. We'll be examining data compiled by a research group known as The Echo Nest. 
Our goal is to look through this dataset and classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one ourselves and in doing so, help the customers achieve a better level of product satisfaction while enabling the service providers achieve a higher level of user engagement.

Since, new songs released by artists donâ€™t necessarily have a genre label attached to them, the Machine Learning algorithm developed would help speed up this process for the stakeholders.

The notebook with the .ipynb label contains specified cells for data overview, cleaning, exploratory insight analysis, modelling, and evaluations respectively. The relevant graphs can also be found in the outputs of the respective code cells as well.
